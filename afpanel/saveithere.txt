		When you Join, you will need to donate the sum of either N10,000, N20,000, N50,000, N100,000 or N200,000 to a fellow member assigned by the system or your direct link, and the member will then confirm your donation and then the system will automatically assign 2 other registered people under you from spillovers who will also pay you the joining amount each, into your bank account, making 100% (i.e. 100% of N10,000 is N20,000, 100% of N20,000 is N40,000, 100% of N50,000 is N100,000, 100% of N100,000 is N200,000 and 100% of N200,000 is N400,000).
		</p><br>
		<p>ZP will assign referrals to pay you. After you have received payment from 2 people under you, the system will automatically EXIT you and allows unlimited registration. All donations are made directly to member bank account. Share ZP to people and make the world a better place.</p>
